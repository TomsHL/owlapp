# Owlapp : Technical test for Owlint

## Disclaimer
This is a project I did for a technical test. It will not be maintained past January 2022, and is NOT to be used in production without extensive testing, as I cannot guarantee safe nor stable functioning. 

Apart from this, please help yourself to anything in here that could help you ðŸ™‚.   Also, please feel free to send me a message if something is not clear or if you need help with my code (note that I cannot guarantee response delay).
